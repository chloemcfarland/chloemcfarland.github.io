        <h1>Susan Sontag: On Photography</h1>
        <h2> Excerpts:</h2></header>
    <p> "Just as a camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a subliminal murder - a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time. Photographs are a way of imprisoning reality... One can't possess reality, one can possess images--one can't possess the present but one can possess the past. </p>
        <p> All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt."

        <header> <h1> My Thoughts:</h1></header>
  <p>   Susan Sontag is a legend when it comes to photographic theory and critique, and up there with the likes of Walter Benjamin, there's no doubt about it. And I have an immense amount of respect for her. However, I do find some of her thoughts on photography interesting, and though I believe in them in part, her seemingly negative tone I often do not agree with. </p>
        <p> It is interesting that Sontag points out the similarity in the language that we use to describe using a camera to photograph and using a gun to kill/injure something. Though sometimes photography can be a violent act, I believe more often it is not. And, I don't see it as a "soft-murder," or a "sad, frightened time." This language adds such a negative connotation to a techniological and art form as fascinating and magical as photography. I also think describing taking a photograph as a moment that describes "mortality" is really interesting, but I don't agree with it. The way I see it, its the exact opposite. Nothing will ever be the same again as the exact moment in time that you created a photo, its irreplicable. Therefore, its the exact opposite of mortality, and becomes an immortal moment in time.
