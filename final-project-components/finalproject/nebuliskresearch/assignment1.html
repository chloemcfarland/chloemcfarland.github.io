         <p>"404 Page Not Found" reflects on the evolution of the internet, particularly the transition from the early, amateur-driven Web 1.0 to today’s hyper&ndash;commercialized, app&ndash;driven internet, while offering a personal and nostalgic perspective on the changes that have occurred. It critiques the loss of creative agency and personal expression that was evident of the early internet and laments the rise of polished, corporate&ndash;controlled platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These platforms have replaced the DIY spirit of earlier internet platforms of the 2000s, which allowed users to craft their own web pages and build communities through personal, often messy, and amateurish designs. </p> 
<p>To me, one of the most interesting ideas Wagner presents is the concept of "technological cannibalism," where the new internet feeds off the old, stripping it of its creativity and individuality, while repackaging it in a way that appeals to nostalgia. Wagner's reflection on her own internet experiences, from the clunky Geocities websites to the highly personalized Myspace profiles, illustrates a tension between the chaotic, open&ndash;ended nature of the early internet, and the controlled aesthetic of Web 2.0 and beyond. This shift from user&ndash;generated spaces to corporate&ndash;driven platforms, represents not just a technological evolution but also a cultural one, where the internet is no longer a place of creative experimentation but a space curated by algorithms and driven by profitability.This notion of "the hell of beautiful interfaces" captures the frustration of many seasoned internet users who long for the chaotic freedom of the early web. While platforms like Facebook and Instagram may be visually appealing, they lack the personal touch that made early internet experiences so memorable. The comparison between the "ghetto" Myspace and the "ivy league" Facebook underscores the idea that the transition to Web 2.0 was not just about aesthetics or functionality, but also about class and cultural aspirations. Users of Myspace, with its gaudy and glitter&mdash;filled profiles, had a level of creative control that Facebook’s streamlined, minimalist design did not offer. Yet, many users migrated to Facebook because of its association with professionalism and social prestige, even though it meant giving up the freedom to fully customize their online presence. </p> 
<p> This is additionally ironic considering what Facebook has become today, as Wagner talks about later in the reading. Not that Facebook has changed in the sense of its user generation, but in the sense that with the large majority of people under 40, Facebook has lost a lot of its credibility and status as a higher end web platform, and become a breeding ground for bots, foreign interference, fake news, and conspiracy theories.
The text also touches on the impermanence of digital culture (which is such a fascinating topic to me), particularly the erasure of personal histories. Despite the common warning that "what you post online stays forever," Wagner points out that much of the early internet has already disappeared. Websites, forums, and personal pages that once housed vibrant communities and creative content are now gone, mostly without any attempt to archive or preserve them. It's interesting to think about the looming permanence of the internet, but the simultaneous and often more realistic impermanence, specifically when speaking about websites and similar types of content (rather than social media platforms). When a website shuts down, there is a loss of content that receives little mourning, and usually is not archived in any way.</p>
<p> Olia Lialina's work to archive Geocities and similar projects offers a glimpse into what could be done to preserve the history of the early internet. However, Wagner makes it clear that such efforts are rare and often undervalued. The internet’s rapid pace of change, driven by corporate interests and technological advancement, leaves little room for reflection on the personal and cultural significance of the spaces that are lost. Wagner's nostalgia for the old internet is not just about missing a particular aesthetic or set of features; it is about missing a time when the internet felt like a space for experimentation, personal expression, and community-building, rather than a platform for data mining and consumerism. </p>
<p> I think the lack of archiving of the internet and the uninterest in preserving it reflects a huge part of our modern culture, and the short attention span we seem to have with everything - trends, social media platforms, and all kinds of media. When we as a society aren't able to hold our attention to anything, it makes sense that we'd be able to scrap it without a second thought about its meaning or place in history. </p>
